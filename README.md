# Backtester
A demo backtester I have developed, basic strategies are avaliable to demonstrate its use.

**To run the backtester:**
1.) You must have streamlit installed, the basic GUI library that I decided to use.
2.) type 'streamlit run thisfile.py' into command line
3.) a window will open and you may test away.


It's my first time using anything other than Powershell/Terminal to display my software, so enjoy the interactive experience!
Thanks for checking it out,
