# Backtester
A demo backtester I have developed, basic strategies are avaliable to demonstrate its use.

**To run the backtester:**


1.) type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' into command line


2.) type 'streamlit run backtest.py' into command line


3.) a window will open and you may test away.


It's my first time using anything other than Powershell/Terminal to display my software, so enjoy the interactive experience!
Thanks for checking it out,
